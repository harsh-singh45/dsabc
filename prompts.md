# Copy-Paste Prompts

## Starting New Session

```
Read instructions.md and be ready for new task
```

## Component Development

```
Create a [ComponentName] component following the design system patterns. Requirements:
- TypeScript with proper types
- 80%+ test coverage
- Storybook stories with all variants
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard support)
- Use existing design tokens
- Follow BEM methodology
```

```
Review existing [SimilarComponent] and create [NewComponent] following the same patterns
```

## Token Management

```
Check if token exists for [property]. If not, propose new token with approval request.
```

```
Add color token [name] with value [hex]. Update base.json, semantic.json, rebuild tokens.
```

## Bug Fixes

```
Fix [issue] in [ComponentName]. Write failing test first, then fix.
```

```
Debug [error message] - investigate and fix with tests
```

## Code Quality

```
Review [ComponentName] for accessibility issues and fix
```

```
Refactor [ComponentName] to improve [aspect] while maintaining tests
```

```
Add comprehensive tests for [ComponentName] - target 80%+ coverage
```

## Long Projects

```
Long project: [Feature Name]
Create plan.md with phases and implementation plan
```

```
Continue from plan.md - Phase [N]
```

```
Update plan.md - mark Phase [N] complete, summarize outcomes
```

## Context Management

```
Checkpoint - update plan.md with completed phases summary
```

```
Fresh session - read plan.md and continue from Phase [N]
```

## Investigation

```
Analyze [ComponentName] structure and patterns
```

```
Find all usages of [token/component/function]
```

```
Compare [ComponentA] and [ComponentB] implementation approaches
```

## Documentation

```
Create Storybook story for [ComponentName] with [variants]
```

```
Add JSDoc comments to [ComponentName] props and methods
```

## Quick Fixes

```
Fix TypeScript errors in [file]
```

```
Fix lint errors in [directory]
```

```
Update [ComponentName] to use design tokens instead of hardcoded values
```

## Pre-Commit

```
Run all checks (lint, type-check, tests). If passing, create changeset.
```

## Publishing

```
Create changeset for [change type]: [description]
```
